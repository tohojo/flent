Running Flent
=============

When run, flent must be supplied either (a) a test name and one or more host
names to connect to, or (b) one or more input files containing data from
previous runs to post-process.

Test names, hostnames and input file names can all be specified as unqualified
arguments, and flent will do its best to guess which is which. For each
argument, if it is an existing file, it is assumed to be an input file, if it is
the name of an existing test configuration it’s assumed to be a test name, and
if neither of those are true, it is assumed to be a host name. The :option:`-i`
and :option:`-H` switches can be used to explicitly specify the interpretation
of an argument.

Invocation
----------

**flent** [*options*\ ] *<host\|test\|input file* ...\ *>*



General options
---------------

.. option:: -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT

   File to write processed output to (default standard out).

.. option:: -D DATA_DIR, --data-dir=DATA_DIR

   Directory to store data files in. Defaults to the current directory.

.. option:: -i INPUT, --input=INPUT

   File to read input from (instead of running tests). Input files can also be
   specified as unqualified arguments without using the :option:`-i` switch.

.. option:: -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT

   Select output format (plot, csv, org\_table, stats). Default is no processed
   output (just writes the JSON data file).

.. option:: -p PLOT, --plot=PLOT

   Select which plot to output for the given test (implies :option:`-f` plot). Use the
   :option:`--list-plots` option to see available plots.

.. option:: -t TITLE, --title-extra=TITLE

   Text to add to plot title and data file name.

.. option:: -n NOTE, --note=NOTE

   Add arbitrary text as a note to be stored in the JSON data file (under the
   *NOTE* key in the metadata object).

.. option:: -r RCFILE, --rcfile=RCFILE

   Load configuration data from *RCFILE* (default *~/.flentrc*). See section
   below for information on the rc file format.

.. option:: -x, --extended-metadata

   Collect extended metadata and store it with the data file. May include
   details of your machine you don’t want to distribute; see the section on the
   data format below.

.. option:: --remote-metadata=HOSTNAME

   Collect extended metadata from a remote host. *HOSTNAME* is passed verbatim
   to ssh, so can include hosts specified in ~/.ssh/config. Note that gathering
   the data can take some time, since it involves executing several remote
   commands. This option can be specified multiple times and implies
   :option:`--extended-metadata`.

.. option:: --gui

   Run the flent GUI. All other options are used as defaults in the GUI, but can
   be changed once it is running. The GUI can also be started by running the
   :command:`flent-gui` binary. For more information on the GUI, see :doc:`gui`.

.. option:: --new-gui-instance

   Start a new GUI instance. Otherwise, flent will try to connect to an already
   running GUI instance and have that load any new data files specified as
   arguments. Implies :option:`--gui` when passed on the command line, but not when
   set in the rc file. Note that when multiple GUI instances are running, there
   is no guarantee as to which instance will get a subsequent open request (if
   run again without :option:`--new-gui-instance`).

.. option:: --gui-no-defer

   Normally, the GUI defers redrawing plots until they are needed to avoid
   redrawing all open plots every time an option changes. This switch turns off
   that optimisation in favour of always redrawing everything straight away.
   This is useful when loading a bunch of plots from the command line and then
   wanting to flip through them without drawing delay.

.. option:: -b BATCH_NAME, --batch-name=BATCH_NAME

   Run test batch BATCH\_NAME (must be specified in a batch file loaded by the
   :option:`--batch-file` option). Can be supplied multiple times.

.. option:: -B BATCH_FILE, --batch-file=BATCH_FILE

   Load batch file BATCH_FILE. Can be specified multiple times, in which case
   the files will be combined (with identically-named sections being overridden
   by later files). See appropriate section below for an explanation of the
   batch file format.

.. option:: --batch-override=key=value

   Override parameter ’key’ in the batch config and set it to ’value’. The key
   name will be case folded to lower case. Can be specified multiple times.

.. option:: --batch-dry-run

   Dry batch run. Prints what would be done, but doesn’t actually run any tests.

.. option:: --batch-repetitions=REPETITIONS

   Shorthand for :option:`--batch-override` ``'repetitions=REPETITIONS’``.

.. option:: --batch-resume=DIR

   Try to resume a previously interrupted batch run. The argument is the
   top-level output directory from the previous run.

   This will attempt to find a data file in the resume directory and load the
   BATCH_TIME from the previous run from that and continue. The assumption is
   that the output directory and filenames are generated from the batch time, so
   that they will match with the previous run when the same time is used. Then,
   tests for which data files already exist will be skipped on this run. If the
   rest of the batch invocation is different from the one being resumed, results
   may not be what you want.

   There's a check to ensure that the generated output path is a subdirectory of
   the resume directory, and the whole run will be aborted if it isn't.

Test configuration options
--------------------------

These options affect the behaviour of the test being run and have no effect when
parsing input files.

.. option :: -H HOST, --host=HOST

   Host to connect to for tests. For tests that support it, multiple hosts can
   be specified by supplying this option multiple times. Hosts can also be
   specified as unqualified arguments; this parameter guarantees that the
   argument be interpreted as a host name (rather than being subject to
   auto-detection between input files, hostnames and test names).

.. option:: --local-bind=IP

   Local hostname or IP address to bind to (for test tools that support this).

.. option:: -l LENGTH, --length=LENGTH

   Base test length (some tests may add some time to this).

.. option:: -s STEP_SIZE, --step-size=STEP_SIZE

   Measurement data point step size.

.. option:: -d DELAY, --delay=DELAY

   Number of seconds to delay parts of test (such as bandwidth loaders).

.. option:: -4, --ipv4

   Use IPv4 for tests (some tests may ignore this).

.. option:: -6, --ipv6

   Use IPv6 for tests (some tests may ignore this).

.. option:: --socket-timeout=SOCKET_TIMEOUT

   Socket timeout (in seconds) used for UDP delay measurement, to prevent stalls
   on packet loss. Only enabled if the installed netperf version is detected to
   support this (requires SVN version of netperf).

   For the default value, see the output of flent :option:`-h`. The value of
   this parameter is an implicit upper bound on how long a round-trip time that
   can be measured. As such you may need to adjust it if you are experiencing
   latency above the default value. Set to 0 to disable.

.. option:: --test-parameter=key=value

   Arbitrary test parameter in key=value format. Key will be case folded to
   lower case. Some test configurations may alter behaviour based on values
   passed as test parameters. Additionally, the values are stored with the
   results metadata, and so can be used for arbitrary resultset categorisation.
   Can be specified multiple times.

.. option:: --swap-up-down

   Switch upstream and downstream directions for data transfer. This means that
   ’upload’ will become ’download’ and vice versa. Works by exchanging netperf
   ``TCP_MAERTS`` and ``TCP_STREAM`` parameters, so only works for tests that employ
   these as their data transfer, and only for the TCP streams.

Plot configuration options
--------------------------

These options are used to configure the appearance of plot output and only make
sense combined with :option:`-f` *plot*.

.. option:: -z, --zero-y

   Always start y axis of plot at zero, instead of autoscaling the axis (also
   disables log scales). Autoscaling is still enabled for the upper bound.

.. option:: -I, --invert-latency-y

   Invert the y-axis for latency data series (making plots show ’better values
   upwards’).

.. option:: --disable-log

   Disable log scales on plots.

.. option:: --norm-factor=FACTOR

   Factor to normalise data by. I.e. divide all data points by this value. Can
   be specified multiple times, in which case each value corresponds to a data
   series.

.. option:: --scale-data=SCALE_DATA

   Additional data files to consider when scaling the plot axes (for plotting
   several plots with identical axes). Note, this displays only the first data
   set, but with axis scaling taking into account the additional data sets. Can
   be supplied multiple times; see also :option:`--scale-mode`.

.. option:: -S, --scale-mode

   Treat file names (except for the first one) passed as unqualified arguments
   as if passed as :option:`--scale-data` (default as if passed as
   :option:`--input`).

.. option:: --concatenate

   Concatenate multiple result sets into one data series. This means that each
   data file will have its time axis shifted by the preceding series duration
   and appended to the first data set specified. Only works for data sets from
   the same test, obviously.

.. option:: --absolute-time

   Plot data points with absolute UNIX time on the x-axis. This requires the
   absolute starting time for the test run to be stored in the data file, and so
   it won’t work with data files that predates this feature.

.. option:: --subplot-combine

   When plotting multiple data series, plot each one on a separate subplot
   instead of combining them into one plot. This mode is not supported for all
   plot types, and only works when :option:`--scale-mode` is disabled.

.. option:: --no-print-n

   Do not print the number of data points on combined plots. When using plot
   types that combines results from several test runs, the number of data series
   in each combined data point is normally added after the series name, (n=X)
   for X data series. This option turns that off.

.. option:: --no-annotation

   Exclude annotation with hostnames, time and test length from plots.

.. option:: --no-title

   Exclude title from plots.

.. option:: --override-title=TITLE

   Override plot title with this string. Completely discards the configured
   title (from the test configuration), as well as the title stored in the data
   set, and replaces it with the value supplied here. This is useful to override
   the plot title *at the time of plotting*, for instance to add a title to an
   aggregate plot from several data series. When this parameter is specified,
   :option:`--no-title` has no effect.

.. option:: --no-markers

   Don’t use line markers to differentiate data series on plots.

.. option:: --no-legend

   Exclude legend from plots.

.. option:: --filter-legend

   Filter legend labels by removing the longest common substring from all
   entries. This is not particularly smart, so should be used with care.

.. option:: --filter-regexp=REGEXP

   Filter the plot legend by the supplied regular expression. Note that for
   combining several plot results, the regular expression is also applied before
   the grouping logic, meaning that a too wide filter can mess up the grouping.

.. option:: --figure-width=FIG_WIDTH

   Figure width in inches. Used when saving plots to file and for default size
   of the interactive plot window.

.. option:: --figure-height=FIG_HEIGHT

   Figure height in inches. Used when saving plots to file and for default size
   of the interactive plot window.

.. option:: --figure-dpi=FIG_DPI

   Figure DPI. Used when saving plots to raster format files.

.. option:: --no-matplotlibrc

   Don’t load included matplotlibrc values. Use this if autodetection of custom
   matplotlibrc fails and flent is inadvertently overriding rc values.

.. option:: --no-hover-highlight

   Don't highlight data series on hover in interactive plot views. Use this if
   redrawing is too slow, or the highlighting is undesired for other reasons.

Test tool-related options
-------------------------
.. option:: --control-host=HOST

   Hostname for the test control connection (for test tools that support this).
   Default: First hostname of test target.

   When running tests that uses D-ITG as a test tool (such as the voip-\*
   tests), this switch controls where flent will look for the D-ITG control
   server (see section below on running tests with D-ITG). For Netperf-based
   tests, this option is passed to Netperf to control where to point the control
   connection. This is useful to, for instance, to run the control server
   communication over a separate control network so as to not interfere with
   test traffic.

.. option:: --control-local-bind=IP

   Local hostname or IP to bind control connection to (for test tools that
   support it; currently netperf). If not supplied, the value for
   :option:`--local-bind` will be used. Note that if this value is passed but
   :option:`--local-bind` is *not*, netperf will use the value specified here to
   bind the data connections to as well.

.. option:: --netperf-control-port=PORT

   Port for Netperf control server. Default: 12865.

.. option:: --ditg-control-port=PORT

   Port for D-ITG control server. Default: 8000.

.. option:: --ditg-control-secret=SECRET

   Secret for D-ITG control server authentication. Default: ’’.

.. option:: --http-getter-urllist=FILENAME

   When running HTTP tests, the http-getter tool is used to fetch URLs (see
   https://github.com/tohojo/http-getter). This option specifies the filename
   containing the list of HTTP URLs to get. Can also be a URL, which will then
   be downloaded as part of each test iteration. If not specified, this is set
   to http://<hostname>/filelist.txt where <hostname> is the first test
   hostname.

.. option:: --http-getter-dns-servers=DNS_SERVERS

   DNS servers to use for http-getter lookups. Format is
   host[:port][,host[:port]]... This option will only work if libcurl supports
   it (needs to be built with the ares resolver). Default is none (use the
   system resolver).

.. option:: --http-getter-timeout=MILLISECONDS

   Timeout for HTTP connections. Default is to use the test length.

.. option:: --http-getter-workers=NUMBER

   Number of workers to use for getting HTTP urls. Default is 4.

Misc and debugging options:
---------------------------

.. option::  -L LOG_FILE, --log-file=LOG_FILE

   Write debug log (test program output) to log file.

.. option:: --list-tests

   List available tests and exit.

.. option:: --list-plots

   List available plots for selected test and exit.

.. option:: -V, --version

   Show Flent version information and exit.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Show usage help message and exit.


Signals
-------

Flent will abort what it is currently doing on receiving a **SIGINT** -- this
includes killing all runners, cleaning up temporary files and shutting down as
gracefully as possible. Runners are killed with **SIGTERM** in this mode, and
their output is discarded. If a batch run is in progress, the current test will
be interrupted in this way, and the rest of the batch run is aborted. Previously
completed tests and their results are not aborted. Post-commands marked as
’essential’ will be run after the test is interrupted. Additionally, flent
converts **SIGTERM** into **SIGINT** internally and reacts accordingly.

Upon receiving a **SIGUSR1**, flent will try to gracefully abort the test it is
currently running, and parse the output of the runners to the extent that any
such output exists. That is, each runner will be killed by a **SIGINT**, which
will cause a graceful shutdown for at least ping and netperf (although netperf
running in *TCP_MAERTS* mode will bug out when interrupted like this, so
end-of-tests statistics will be missing). Flent will only react once to a
**SIGUSR1**, sending exactly one **SIGINT** to the active runners, then wait for
them to exit. This may take several seconds in the case of netperf. If the
runners for some reason fail to exit, flent will be stuck and will need to be
killed with **SIGINT**. If running in batch mode, **SIGUSR1** will only affect
the currently running test; subsequent tests will still be run.
