.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Flent is a wrapper around \fInetperf\fP and similar tools to run predefined
tests and aggregate and plot the results. It defines several tests that
can be run against one or more hosts, primarily targeted at testing for
the presence of bufferbloat under various conditions.
.sp
The aggregated data is saved in (gzipped) JSON format for later
processing and/or import into other tools. The JSON format is documented
below.
.sp
Apart from the JSON format, the data can be output as csv values, emacs
org mode tables or plots. Each test can specify several different plots,
including time\-series plots of the values against each other, as well as
CDF plots of (e.g.) ping times.
.sp
Plots can be output to the formats supported by matplotlib by specifying
the output filename with \fB\-o\fP \fIoutput.{png,ps,pdf,svg}\fP\&. If no output
file is specified, the plot is diplayed using matplotlib’s interactive
plot browser, which also allows saving of the output (in .png format).
.SS Requirements
.sp
Flent runs on Python, versions 2.7+ and 3.3+. Plotting requires a functional
\fBmatplotlib\fP installation (but everything else can run without
\fBmatplotlib\fP). For the interactive plot viewer, a graphical display (and
suitably configured \fBmatplotlib\fP) is required.
.sp
Most tests employ the netperf benchmarking tool to run the tests. Version 2.6 or
higher is required, and netperf must be compiled with the
\fB\-\-enable\-demo\fP option passed to \fB\&./configure\fP\&. Some tests use
iperf in addition to, or instead of netperf. Both tools must be available in the
\fBPATH\fP\&.
.sp
For ICMP ping measurements, the version of ping employed must support output
timestamping (the \-D parameter to GNU ping). This is not supported by the BSD
and OSX versions of ping. As an alternative to the regular ping command, the
\fBfping\fP utility (see \fI\%http://fping.org\fP) can be employed. In that case
fping must be version 3.5 or greater. Flent will attempt to detect the presence
of fping in the \fBPATH\fP and check for support for the \-D parameter. If
this check is successful, \fBfping\fP will be employed for ping data,
otherwise the system ping will be used.
.SH RUNNING FLENT
.sp
When run, flent must be supplied either (a) a test name and one or more host
names to connect to, or (b) one or more input files containing data from
previous runs to post\-process.
.sp
Test names, hostnames and input file names can all be specified as unqualified
arguments, and flent will do its best to guess which is which. For each
argument, if it is an existing file, it is assumed to be an input file, if it is
the name of an existing test configuration it’s assumed to be a test name, and
if neither of those are true, it is assumed to be a host name. The \fI\%\-i\fP
and \fI\%\-H\fP switches can be used to explicitly specify the interpretation
of an argument.
.SS Invocation
.sp
\fBflent\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fI<host|test|input file\fP ...\fI>\fP
.SS General options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o OUTPUT, \-\-output=OUTPUT
File to write processed output to (default standard out).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D DATA_DIR, \-\-data\-dir=DATA_DIR
Directory to store data files in. Defaults to the current directory.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i INPUT, \-\-input=INPUT
File to read input from (instead of running tests). Input files can also be
specified as unqualified arguments without using the \fI\%\-i\fP switch.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f FORMAT, \-\-format=FORMAT
Select output format (plot, csv, org_table, stats). Default is no processed
output (just writes the JSON data file).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p PLOT, \-\-plot=PLOT
Select which plot to output for the given test (implies \fI\%\-f\fP plot). Use the
\fI\%\-\-list\-plots\fP option to see available plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t TITLE, \-\-title\-extra=TITLE
Text to add to plot title and data file name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n NOTE, \-\-note=NOTE
Add arbitrary text as a note to be stored in the JSON data file (under the
\fINOTE\fP key in the metadata object).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r RCFILE, \-\-rcfile=RCFILE
Load configuration data from \fIRCFILE\fP (default \fI~/.flentrc\fP). See section
below for information on the rc file format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-extended\-metadata
Collect extended metadata and store it with the data file. May include
details of your machine you don’t want to distribute; see the section on the
data format below.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-remote\-metadata=HOSTNAME
Collect extended metadata from a remote host. \fIHOSTNAME\fP is passed verbatim
to ssh, so can include hosts specified in ~/.ssh/config. Note that gathering
the data can take some time, since it involves executing several remote
commands. This option can be specified multiple times and implies
\fI\%\-\-extended\-metadata\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gui
Run the flent GUI. All other options are used as defaults in the GUI, but can
be changed once it is running. The GUI can also be started by running the
\fBflent\-gui\fP binary. For more information on the GUI, see \fBgui\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-new\-gui\-instance
Start a new GUI instance. Otherwise, flent will try to connect to an already
running GUI instance and have that load any new data files specified as
arguments. Implies \fI\%\-\-gui\fP when passed on the command line, but not when
set in the rc file. Note that when multiple GUI instances are running, there
is no guarantee as to which instance will get a subsequent open request (if
run again without \fI\%\-\-new\-gui\-instance\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gui\-no\-defer
Normally, the GUI defers redrawing plots until they are needed to avoid
redrawing all open plots every time an option changes. This switch turns off
that optimisation in favour of always redrawing everything straight away.
This is useful when loading a bunch of plots from the command line and then
wanting to flip through them without drawing delay.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b BATCH_NAME, \-\-batch\-name=BATCH_NAME
Run test batch BATCH_NAME (must be specified in a batch file loaded by the
\fI\%\-\-batch\-file\fP option). Can be supplied multiple times.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B BATCH_FILE, \-\-batch\-file=BATCH_FILE
Load batch file BATCH_FILE. Can be specified multiple times, in which case
the files will be combined (with identically\-named sections being overridden
by later files). See appropriate section below for an explanation of the
batch file format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-batch\-override=key=value
Override parameter ’key’ in the batch config and set it to ’value’. The key
name will be case folded to lower case. Can be specified multiple times.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-batch\-dry\-run
Dry batch run. Prints what would be done, but doesn’t actually run any tests.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-batch\-repetitions=REPETITIONS
Shorthand for \fI\%\-\-batch\-override\fP \fB\(aqrepetitions=REPETITIONS’\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-batch\-resume=DIR
Try to resume a previously interrupted batch run. The argument is the
top\-level output directory from the previous run.
.sp
This will attempt to find a data file in the resume directory and load the
BATCH_TIME from the previous run from that and continue. The assumption is
that the output directory and filenames are generated from the batch time, so
that they will match with the previous run when the same time is used. Then,
tests for which data files already exist will be skipped on this run. If the
rest of the batch invocation is different from the one being resumed, results
may not be what you want.
.sp
There\(aqs a check to ensure that the generated output path is a subdirectory of
the resume directory, and the whole run will be aborted if it isn\(aqt.
.UNINDENT
.SS Test configuration options
.sp
These options affect the behaviour of the test being run and have no effect when
parsing input files.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-H HOST, \-\-host=HOST
Host to connect to for tests. For tests that support it, multiple hosts can
be specified by supplying this option multiple times. Hosts can also be
specified as unqualified arguments; this parameter guarantees that the
argument be interpreted as a host name (rather than being subject to
auto\-detection between input files, hostnames and test names).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-local\-bind=IP
Local hostname or IP address to bind to (for test tools that support this).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l LENGTH, \-\-length=LENGTH
Base test length (some tests may add some time to this).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s STEP_SIZE, \-\-step\-size=STEP_SIZE
Measurement data point step size.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d DELAY, \-\-delay=DELAY
Number of seconds to delay parts of test (such as bandwidth loaders).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-4, \-\-ipv4
Use IPv4 for tests (some tests may ignore this).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-6, \-\-ipv6
Use IPv6 for tests (some tests may ignore this).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-socket\-timeout=SOCKET_TIMEOUT
Socket timeout (in seconds) used for UDP delay measurement, to prevent stalls
on packet loss. Only enabled if the installed netperf version is detected to
support this (requires SVN version of netperf).
.sp
For the default value, see the output of flent \fI\%\-h\fP\&. The value of
this parameter is an implicit upper bound on how long a round\-trip time that
can be measured. As such you may need to adjust it if you are experiencing
latency above the default value. Set to 0 to disable.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-test\-parameter=key=value
Arbitrary test parameter in key=value format. Key will be case folded to
lower case. Some test configurations may alter behaviour based on values
passed as test parameters. Additionally, the values are stored with the
results metadata, and so can be used for arbitrary resultset categorisation.
Can be specified multiple times.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-swap\-up\-down
Switch upstream and downstream directions for data transfer. This means that
’upload’ will become ’download’ and vice versa. Works by exchanging netperf
\fBTCP_MAERTS\fP and \fBTCP_STREAM\fP parameters, so only works for tests that employ
these as their data transfer, and only for the TCP streams.
.UNINDENT
.SS Plot configuration options
.sp
These options are used to configure the appearance of plot output and only make
sense combined with \fI\%\-f\fP \fIplot\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-z, \-\-zero\-y
Always start y axis of plot at zero, instead of autoscaling the axis (also
disables log scales). Autoscaling is still enabled for the upper bound.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-invert\-latency\-y
Invert the y\-axis for latency data series (making plots show ’better values
upwards’).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-log
Disable log scales on plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-norm\-factor=FACTOR
Factor to normalise data by. I.e. divide all data points by this value. Can
be specified multiple times, in which case each value corresponds to a data
series.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-scale\-data=SCALE_DATA
Additional data files to consider when scaling the plot axes (for plotting
several plots with identical axes). Note, this displays only the first data
set, but with axis scaling taking into account the additional data sets. Can
be supplied multiple times; see also \fI\%\-\-scale\-mode\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-scale\-mode
Treat file names (except for the first one) passed as unqualified arguments
as if passed as \fI\%\-\-scale\-data\fP (default as if passed as
\fI\%\-\-input\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-concatenate
Concatenate multiple result sets into one data series. This means that each
data file will have its time axis shifted by the preceding series duration
and appended to the first data set specified. Only works for data sets from
the same test, obviously.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-absolute\-time
Plot data points with absolute UNIX time on the x\-axis. This requires the
absolute starting time for the test run to be stored in the data file, and so
it won’t work with data files that predates this feature.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-subplot\-combine
When plotting multiple data series, plot each one on a separate subplot
instead of combining them into one plot. This mode is not supported for all
plot types, and only works when \fI\%\-\-scale\-mode\fP is disabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-print\-n
Do not print the number of data points on combined plots. When using plot
types that combines results from several test runs, the number of data series
in each combined data point is normally added after the series name, (n=X)
for X data series. This option turns that off.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-annotation
Exclude annotation with hostnames, time and test length from plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-title
Exclude title from plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-override\-title=TITLE
Override plot title with this string. Completely discards the configured
title (from the test configuration), as well as the title stored in the data
set, and replaces it with the value supplied here. This is useful to override
the plot title \fIat the time of plotting\fP, for instance to add a title to an
aggregate plot from several data series. When this parameter is specified,
\fI\%\-\-no\-title\fP has no effect.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-markers
Don’t use line markers to differentiate data series on plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-legend
Exclude legend from plots.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-filter\-legend
Filter legend labels by removing the longest common substring from all
entries. This is not particularly smart, so should be used with care.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-filter\-regexp=REGEXP
Filter the plot legend by the supplied regular expression. Note that for
combining several plot results, the regular expression is also applied before
the grouping logic, meaning that a too wide filter can mess up the grouping.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-figure\-width=FIG_WIDTH
Figure width in inches. Used when saving plots to file and for default size
of the interactive plot window.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-figure\-height=FIG_HEIGHT
Figure height in inches. Used when saving plots to file and for default size
of the interactive plot window.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-figure\-dpi=FIG_DPI
Figure DPI. Used when saving plots to raster format files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-matplotlibrc
Don’t load included matplotlibrc values. Use this if autodetection of custom
matplotlibrc fails and flent is inadvertently overriding rc values.
.UNINDENT
.SS Test tool\-related options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-control\-host=HOST
Hostname for the test control connection (for test tools that support this).
Default: First hostname of test target.
.sp
When running tests that uses D\-ITG as a test tool (such as the voip\-*
tests), this switch controls where flent will look for the D\-ITG control
server (see section below on running tests with D\-ITG). For Netperf\-based
tests, this option is passed to Netperf to control where to point the control
connection. This is useful to, for instance, to run the control server
communication over a separate control network so as to not interfere with
test traffic.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-control\-local\-bind=IP
Local hostname or IP to bind control connection to (for test tools that
support it; currently netperf). If not supplied, the value for
\fI\%\-\-local\-bind\fP will be used. Note that if this value is passed but
\fI\%\-\-local\-bind\fP is \fInot\fP, netperf will use the value specified here to
bind the data connections to as well.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-http\-getter\-urllist=FILENAME
When running HTTP tests, the http\-getter tool is used to fetch URLs (see
\fI\%https://github.com/tohojo/http\-getter\fP). This option specifies the filename
containing the list of HTTP URLs to get. Can also be a URL, which will then
be downloaded as part of each test iteration. If not specified, this is set
to \fI\%http:/\fP/<hostname>/filelist.txt where <hostname> is the first test
hostname.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-http\-getter\-dns\-servers=DNS_SERVERS
DNS servers to use for http\-getter lookups. Format is
host[:port][,host[:port]]... This option will only work if libcurl supports
it (needs to be built with the ares resolver). Default is none (use the
system resolver).
.UNINDENT

.SS Signals
.sp
Flent will abort what it is currently doing on receiving a \fBSIGINT\fP \-\- this
includes killing all runners, cleaning up temporary files and shutting down as
gracefully as possible. Runners are killed with \fBSIGTERM\fP in this mode, and
their output is discarded. If a batch run is in progress, the current test will
be interrupted in this way, and the rest of the batch run is aborted. Previously
completed tests and their results are not aborted. Post\-commands marked as
’essential’ will be run after the test is interrupted. Additionally, flent
converts \fBSIGTERM\fP into \fBSIGINT\fP internally and reacts accordingly.
.sp
Upon receiving a \fBSIGUSR1\fP, flent will try to gracefully abort the test it is
currently running, and parse the output of the runners to the extent that any
such output exists. That is, each runner will be killed by a \fBSIGINT\fP, which
will cause a graceful shutdown for at least ping and netperf (although netperf
running in \fITCP_MAERTS\fP mode will bug out when interrupted like this, so
end\-of\-tests statistics will be missing). Flent will only react once to a
\fBSIGUSR1\fP, sending exactly one \fBSIGINT\fP to the active runners, then wait for
them to exit. This may take several seconds in the case of netperf. If the
runners for some reason fail to exit, flent will be stuck and will need to be
killed with \fBSIGINT\fP\&. If running in batch mode, \fBSIGUSR1\fP will only affect
the currently running test; subsequent tests will still be run.
.SH SUPPLIED TESTS
.sp
Test are supplied as Python files and can specify commands to run etc.
For a full list of the tests supported by flent, see the
\fB\-\-list\-tests\fP option.
.SS The Realtime Response Under Load (RRUL) test
.sp
This test exists in a couple of variants and is a partial implementation of the
RRUL specification as written by Dave Taht (see
\fI\%https://github.com/dtaht/deBloat/blob/master/spec/rrule.doc?raw=true\fP). It works
by running RTT measurement using ICMP ping and UDP roundtrip time measurement,
while loading up the link with eight TCP streams (four downloads, four uploads).
This quite reliably saturates the measured link (wherever the bottleneck might
be), and thus exposes bufferbloat when it is present.
.SS Simple TCP flow tests
.sp
These tests combine a TCP flow (either in one direction, or both) with an ICMP
ping measurement. It’s a simpler test than RRUL, but in some cases the single
TCP flow can be sufficient to saturate the link.
.SS UDP flood test
.sp
This test runs \fIiperf\fP configured to emit 100Mbps of UDP packets targeted at the
test host, while measuring RTT using ICMP ping. It is useful for observing
latency in the face of a completely unresponsive packet stream.
.SH THE FLENT GUI
.sp
Flent comes equipped with a GUI to browse and plot previously captured datasets.
The GUI requires PyQt4; if this is installed, it can be launched with the
\fB\-\-gui\fP parameter, or by launching the \fBflent\-gui\fP binary.
Additionally, if Flent is launched without parameters and without a controlling
terminal, the GUI will be launched automatically.
.sp
The GUI can be used for interactively plotting previously captured datasets, and
makes it easy to compare results from several test runs. It presents a tabbed
interface to graphs of data files, allows dynamic configuration of plots, and
includes a metadata browser. For each loaded data file, additional data files
can be loaded and added to the plot, similar to what happens when specifying
multiple input files for plotting on the command line. A checkbox controls
whether the added data files are added as separate entries to the plot, or
whether they are used for scaling the output (mirroring the
\fB\-\-scale\-mode\fP) command line switch.
.sp
The GUI also incorporates matplotlib’s interactive browsing toolbar, enabling
panning and zooming of the plot area, dynamic configuration of plot and axis
parameters and labels and saving the plots to file. The exact dynamic features
supported depends on the installed version of matplotlib.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.SS The RC file
.sp
Some of the command line options can be specified in an rc file. By default,
flent looks for this in \fB~/.flentrc\fP, but an alternative location can be
specified with the \fB\-\-rcfile\fP command line option.
.sp
The rc file allows options to be specified globally, an optionally overridden
for specific tests. For an explanation of the options, refer to the annotated
example rc file, by default installed to
\fB/usr/share/doc/flent/flentrc.example\fP\&.
.SS Batch Files
.sp
Flent supports reading batch files to automate running several tests and
do setup/teardown of test environment etc. This greatly aids
reproducibility of tests.
.sp
The batch file format is based on the standard .ini file format, with
sections being split into three namespaces: Commands, starting with
Command::, batches, starting with Batch::, and arguments, starting with
Arg::. Briefly, a batch is the entity that will be run, commands can be
run before or after each batch iteration, and arguments allows
parameterising batches.

.SS Extended metadata
.sp
If the \fB\-\-extended\-metadata\fP switch is turned on, the following
additional values are collected and stored (to the extent they are available
from the platform):
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B KERNEL_NAME
The kernel name as reported by \fBuname \-s\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B KERNEL_RELEASE
The kernel release as reported by \fBuname \-r\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B IP_ADDRS
IP addresses assigned to the machine running flent.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B GATEWAYS
IP addresses of all detected default gateways on the system, and the
interfaces they are reachable through. Only available if the
\fBnetstat\fP binary is present on the system.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B EGRESS_INFO
Egress interface, its qdisc, offload, driver and BQL configuration,
and (if applicable) the IP address of the next\-hop router used to
reach the test target. The egress interface and next\-hop router
requires that the \fBip\fP binary is present on Linux, but can
be extracted from \fBroute\fP on BSD. Qdisc information
requires the \fBtc\fP binary to be present, and offload
information requires \fBethtool\fP\&.
.sp
If the \fB\-\-remote\-metadata\fP is used, the extended metadata
info is gathered for each of the hostnames specified. This is
gathered under the \fBREMOTE_METADATA\fP key in the metadata
object, keyed by the hostname values passed to
\fB\-\-remote\-metadata\fP\&. Additionally, the
\fBREMOTE_METADATA\fP object will contain an object called
\fBINGRESS_INFO\fP which is a duplicate of
\fI\%EGRESS_INFO\fP, but with the destination IP exchanged for the
source address of the host running flent. The assumption here is
that \fB\-\-remote\-metadata\fP is used to capture metadata of a
router known to be in the test path, in which case
\fBINGRESS_INFO\fP will contain information about the reverse
path from the router (which is ingress from the point of view of the
host running flent). If the host being queried for remote metadata
is off the path, the contents of \fBINGRESS_INFO\fP will
probably be the same as that of \fI\%EGRESS_INFO\fP .

.SH OUTPUT FORMATS
.sp
The following output formats are currently supported by Flent:
.SS Plot output (\fB\-f plot\fP)
.sp
Output test data as one of a series of graphical plots of timeseries data or
summarised as a CDF plot. Each test supplies a number of different plots; the
list of plots for a given test is output by the \fB\-\-list\-plots\fP switch
(which must be supplied along with a test name).
.sp
The plots are drawn by matplotlib, and can be displayed on the screen
interactively (requires a graphical display), or output to a file in svg, pdf,
ps and png formats. Using the \fB\-o\fP switch turns out file output (the
file format is inferred from the file name), while not supplying the switch
turns on the interactive plot viewer.
.SS Tabulated output (\fB\-f csv\fP and \fB\-f org_table\fP)
.sp
These formats output the numeric data in a tabulated format to be consumed by
other applications. The \fIcsv\fP output format is a comma\-separated output that can
be imported into e.g. spreadsheets, while \fIorg_table\fP outputs a tabulated output
in the table format supported by Emacs org mode. The data is output in text
format to standard output, or written to a file if invoked with the \fB\-o\fP
parameter.
.SS Statistics output (\fB\-f stats\fP)
.sp
This output format outputs various statistics about the test data, such as total
bandwidth consumed, and various statistical measures (min/max/mean/median/std
dev/variance) for each data source specified in the relevant test (this can
include some data sources not includes on plots). The data is output in text
format to standard output, or written to a file if invoked with the \fB\-o\fP
parameter.
.SS Metadata output (\fB\-f metadata\fP)
.sp
This output format outputs the test metadata as pretty\-printed JSON (also
suitable for human consumption). It is output as a list of objects, where each
object corresponds to the metadata of one test. Mostly useful for inspecting
metadata of stored data files.
.SH MISC INFO
.SS Running Tests With The D\-ITG Tool
.sp
This version of flent has experimental support for running and parsing the
output of the D\-ITG test tool (see
\fI\%http://traffic.comics.unina.it/software/ITG/\fP). Flent supports parsing the
one\-way delay as measured by D\-ITG. However, in order to do so, the data needs
to be collected at the receiver end, statistics extracted, and the result passed
back to flent on the sending side.
.sp
To perform this function, flent supports a control server which will listen to
XML\-RPC requests, spawn an appropriate ITGRecv instance and, after the test is
done, parse its output and make it available for flent to retrieve. This control
server is available as a Python file that by default is installed in
\fB/usr/share/doc/flent/misc\fP\&. It currently requires a patched version of
D\-ITG v2.8.1. The patch is also included in the same directory.
.sp
Note that the D\-ITG server is finicky and not designed with security in mind.
For this reason, the control server includes HMAC authentication to only allow
authenticated clients to run a test against the server; however there is
currently no support for enforcement of this in e.g. firewall rules. Please bear
this in mind when running a publicly reachable ITGRecv instance (with or without
the control server). Another security issue with the control server is that the
Python XML\-RPC library by default is vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks.
For this reason, it is highly recommended to install the \fBdefusedxml\fP
library (available at \fI\%https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml/\fP) on the host
running the control server. The server will try to find the library on startup
and refuse to run if it is not available, unless explicitly told otherwise.
.SS Bugs
.sp
Under some conditions (such as severe bufferbloat), the UDP RTT measurements
done by netperf can experience packet loss to the extent that the test aborts
completely, which can cause missing data points for some measurement series.
The \-\-socket\-timeout feature can alleviate this, but requires a recent SVN
version of netperf to work. Flent tries to detect if netperf supports this
option and enables it for the UDP measurements if it does.
.sp
Probably many other bugs. Please report any found to
\fI\%https://github.com/tohojo/flent/issues\fP and include the output of
\fBflent \-\-version\fP in the report.
