KNOWN ISSUES:

- UDP pings stop completely when packet loss occurs, leaving out results
  for the rest of the test duration. This is how netperf works by
  design; however a better solution is being investigated for future
  netperf versions. In the meantime, please bear this in mind when
  looking at the results; especially for ping time CDF plots.

REPORTING BUGS:

Please report bugs at https://github.com/tohojo/flent/issues
and include as much as possible of the following information with all
reports:

- Output on the console for the error.
- The data file for the test (<testname>-<date>.flent.gz).
- Log file output (rerun the test with -l logfile.txt).
